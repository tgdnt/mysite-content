I will have several short paragraphs linking to other pages that ellaborate on each thing. Each subpage will be very short.

I am a Brazilian immigrant in Kansas City currently working on a portfolio of technical writing seeking to begin a career that field.

I have long loved discovering and exploring business software at every job I've had, and it's always been an area of excellence for me.

At home, I have learned bash scripting to achieve my productivity goals on the computer.

In the past I have worked as a freelance web developer building custom Wordpress themes, and more recently I dove into Jekyll, with which I have built this site, starting off with Poole and taking a lot of inspiration from Indigo.

I have also spent much of my professional career working as a freelance videographer, shooting and editing video mostly in the non-profit sector. My most significant project were a couple of short documentaries that are available on Youtube.

In college, I learned a lot about the history of filmmaking and became a lover of classic films, and am determined to one day be caught up on the history of cinema.

Also there, I learned about communication studies and learned to love writers like Barthes, Deleuze, Baudrillard, McLuhan and others. You know the lot.

I lived in the United Kingdom.
