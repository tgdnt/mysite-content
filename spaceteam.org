Hello! I created this page just to show you how I was one of
three volunteers credited with the Brazilian Portuguese
localization of the free mobile phone game [[https://spaceteam.ca/][Spaceteam]], a
game of cooperative shouting with lots of words in it.

I am credited only in the app itself when you change the
language to Brazilian Portuguese. I would recommend installing
the game any way, but I have included a screenshot at the
bottom of this page so you don't have to.

In addition to the interface itself, localizing Spaceteam deals
with a considerable database of words that are randomly strung
together and need to make sense.

Words are classed as before-noun and after-noun adjectives,
verbs, and more. There is also a small set of predetermined
strings that could not be combined with random words.

Thanks for stopping by!
