** Scripts
*** /todo.sh/ add-ons
/todo.sh/ is the command line interface for /todo.txt/, a syntax for plain text task management, for which I created and shared three add-ons.
They are simply /bash/ scripts that introduce new functions and integrations to /todo.sh/.

I worked on these as much to learn more about /bash scripting/ as to add the functionality I wanted for my own use of /todo.txt/.
Since writing these scripts, I have switched over to /Emacs Org mode/, so their code repositories are now archived.

Often it is beneficial to schedule your todos on your calendar, blocking out some time to work on it.
Some GTD[fn:1] proponents advocate actually scheduling each of your tasks rather than working with a todo list.[fn:2]
For some time years ago, I used an excellent mobile app called /Timeful/ that did just that.[fn:3]

/book/ uses [[https://lostpackets.de/khal/index.html][/khal/]] to create calendar events and can optionally use [[https://vdirsyncer.pimutils.org/en/stable/][/vdirsyncer/]] to synchronize them with various cloud services.
[fn:1] David Allen's very popular productivity paradigm known as [[https://gettingthingsdone.com/][Getting Things Done]].
[fn:2] See Dave Crenshaw's video [[https://www.lynda.com/Business-Software-tutorials/Replace-do-lists-schedule/440668/489450-4.html][/Replace to-do lists with a schedule/]], on Lynda.com. In my /Emacs Org mode/ set-up, my agenda shows undated TODO items under a headline that says "Unscheduled:". So I am encouraged to schedule everything. As Crenshaw argues, it's worth managing your time budget and learning to estimate effort.
[fn:3] Unfortunately, /Timeful/ was /acquihired/ by Google, the app was quickly discontinued with the promise that its functionality would be ported over to Google apps. What I most valued was how the interface allowed you to drag tasks onto a time grid to schedule them. It could also minimize calendar events, so that they wouldn't affect your planning if they don't actually require your attention.
**** /remind/
Project page: [[https://github.com/tgdnt/remind][github.com/tgdnt/remind]] 

/remind/ is my way of getting mobile notifications for todos on an iPhone, because none of the /todo.txt/ mobile apps really do it.
It uses [[https://ss64.com/osx/osascript.html][/osascript/]] to interact with iOS Reminders.
**** /stale/
Project page: [[https://github.com/tgdnt/stale][github.com/tgdnt/stale]] 

On a quest to keep your todo list tidy --- perhaps to achieve "todo list zero" --- I found it useful to have a process for managing "stale" tasks, borrowing Github's word for branches that haven't been committed to in a while.
With ~todo.sh stale~, the user can easily move todo items back and forth between a todo file and a file such as /stale.txt/. Periodically, one would review stale todos to decide whether to just cancel them entirely or restore them.

My plans for this had been to automatically prune todos that had been on your list for a certain amount of time (tracked by a required creation date).
Since switching over to /Emacs Org mode/, I plan to port this over to /Elisp/ to continue developing it there and eventually ~(provide 'org-stale)~.
*** myshifts.sh
Project page: [[https://github.com/tgdnt/myshifts.sh][github.com/tgdnt/myshifts.sh]]

A simple script that creates a series of calendar events for shifts at work.
Here, to facilitate sharing the script on Github, I used a separate configuration file in which a user can specify things like shift length, title of the events etc.

*** PaintDept Instagram

I credit the original idea for this to my co-worker Romario.
As part of our job, we would dispense colorants into paint bases and then put them in a shaker before handing them over to customers.
Sometimes, we would dispense the colorants, then close the can and briefly shake it by hand, before reopening and taking photos of the patterns that formed on the surface.

Here are some of the photos in a 16:10 aspect ratio version.
